The results will be saved into that folder}
\usage{
socsim(
  folder,
  supfile,
  seed = "42",
  process_method = "inprocess",
  compatibility_mode = "1",
  suffix = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{base-directory of the simulation. 
Every SUP- and rate-file should be named relative to this folder.}

\item{supfile}{the .sup file to start the simulation, relative to the
folder}

\item{seed}{RNG seed as string, Default="42"}

\item{process_method}{specify whether and how SOCSIM should be started in its
own process or in the running R process. Use one of
 "inprocess" - SOCSIM runs in the R-process. Beware if you run several different
 simulations - they may affect later simulations
 "future" - the safest option. A new process will be start via the "future"
 package
 "clustercall" - if the future package is not available, try this method instead}
}
\value{
The results will be written into the specified folder
