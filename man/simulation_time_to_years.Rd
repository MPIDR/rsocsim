\title{Calculate for how many years the simulation ran}
\usage{
simulation_time_to_years(simulation_time, pre_simulation_time, start_year)
}
\arguments{
\item{simulation_time}{An integer. The number of periods (months) the
simulation ran.}

\item{pre_simulation_time}{An integer. The number of periods (months) the
simulation ran before getting to a stable population. This is subtracted
from 'simulation_time' in order to arrive at the "real" simulation time}

\item{start_year}{An integer. The year the simulation started.}
}
\value{
An number. The number of years for which the simulation ran. May
have a fractional part.
}
