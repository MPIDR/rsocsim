# Estimate yearly age-specific fertility rates (ASFR) from a SOCSIM-generated population file

Given a population file ('opop') generated by rsocsim, the function
estimates age-specific fertility rates.

## Usage

``` r
estimate_fertility_rates(
  opop,
  final_sim_year,
  year_min,
  year_max,
  year_group = 5,
  age_min_fert = 15,
  age_max_fert = 50,
  age_group = 5
)
```

## Arguments

- opop:

  An R object from SOCSIM microsimulation output (population file).

- final_sim_year:

  numeric. Final simulated year in 'real world' time ( used to convert
  'SOCSIM time' to 'real world' time.)

- year_min:

  numeric. Lower-bound year for which rate should be estimated.

- year_max:

  numeric. Upper-bound year for which rate should be estimated.

- year_group:

  numeric. Size of year groups to estimate rate (year_group=1 will
  produce single-year estimates)

- age_min_fert:

  numeric. Lower-bound age of female reproductive period

- age_max_fert:

  numeric. Upper-bound age of female reproductive period

- age_group:

  numeric. Size of age groups to estimate rate (age_group=1 will produce
  single-age estimates)

## Value

A data.frame with age-specific fertility rates by year and age.

## Details

The `final_sim_year` can be obtained from the .sup file and must refer
to to a real-world year.

Grouped year and age ranges (i.e., if `year_group > 1` or
`age_group > 1`) are created as \[year;year+year_group).

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Read opop file into global environment
opop <- read_opop(path = "my_path")
# Retrieve age-specific fertility rates
asfr <- get_asfr_socsim(opop = opop,
                     final_sim_year = 2021, 
                     year_min = 1750,
                     year_max = 2020,
                     year_group = 5,
                     age_min_fert = 10,
                     age_max_fert = 55,
                     age_group = 5)
} # }
```
